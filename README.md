# PyBer_Analysis

# Resources
Software: Python 3.7.6, JupyterLab 2.26

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to perform a study on Pyber ride sharing services in order to improve access and affordability to underserved neighborhoods. We examined the data types of the cities in which Pyber operates. We also created visualizations to showcase the relationship between the number of drivers, riders and fare cost.  

# Results 
The images below will give a compelling summary of our findings.

# Summary
We should focus on targeting the drivers yield. If we were to increase the drivers in the rural and suburban area we would be able to serve them more efficiently. In the Urban area we see we have more drivers than riders. IF we were to create incentives we could use those surplus of drivers to help accommodate the other areas. This would bring in more revenue without underserving the urban community.
